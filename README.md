### User Stories

```
As a user
I want to register an order
So I can keep track of who is buying and selling silver bars

As a user
I want to cancel an order
So I can keep my list up to date

As a user
I want to get a summary of live orders
So I can make quick decisions about the demand for silver bars

As a user
I want to see the price of 'SELL' orders ordered lowest first
So I can prioritize the information I see about future sales

As a user
I want to see the price of 'BUY' orders ordered highest first
So I can prioritize the information I see about future purchases
